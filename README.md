# Antescher
This is a quick/small demo to see if the Arduboy can do isometric 3D rendering
of the 'Antescher' city used in the 1983 game 'Ant Attack'.

The code is quite slow, there is lots of scope to make it run faster though.

Use arrow keys to move. the 'B' key returns view to start position.

No 'rotate view' implemented yet, but should be trivial.
